# perlin-noise-procedural-hills
Perlin Noise is an algorithm that games use to make various randomly generated things (dungeons, levels, terrain, endless, etc.)  In this tutorial video, I am going to use perlin noise to generate hills.  I generate hills in 2d and in 3d at the end.  I was planning on using this information in combination with my learning about voxels to make a minecraft like world.
